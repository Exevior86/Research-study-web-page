# Research-study-web-page
simple website a researcher can control for a specific study on infants

Had to remove the videos and pictures, but basically the point was to give the researcher the ability to use a keyboard remotely to
control the expirment for children 12-18 months old. The person could stop, pause, and play the video along with being able to move forwards and backwards through the expirement by pressing space bar to move forwards and B to go backwards.
